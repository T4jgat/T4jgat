Backend developer
-----------------

I've been into programming since I was in high school, designing simple HTML pages and programming a console calculator in python. I started to seriously consider my career path as a programmer in the last years of high school. A year ago I entered Astana IT University and am actively studying programming both at the university and on my own. At the moment I stopped on Java Spring Framework stack. But I am also actively studying other technologies, such as Node.js for myself. I have quite a few pet projects, which you can see here. Welcome💫
